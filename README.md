## About Me

I’m a developer from Sri Lanka focused on **Windows desktop tools**, **gaming utilities**, and **performance-oriented software**.

I care deeply about:
- Clean logic and predictable behavior
- Reversible and transparent system changes
- UX that feels like AAA software, not hobby tools
- Building things that actually work — not placebo features

I prefer **shipping fewer projects**, but making them solid.

## Main Project — PulseBoost™ FPS Optimizer

> *“Pro-level gaming optimization, but transparent & reversible.”*

PulseBoost is a Windows desktop application designed to help gamers safely improve system performance **without breaking Windows or hiding risky behavior**.

### Core Focus
- Honest performance tuning
- Clear explanations for every tweak
- Safe defaults and full reversibility

### Tech & Features
- ⚙️ .NET 8 + WPF (MVVM)
- 🎨 Modern dark, GX-style desktop UI
- 🧠 SmartBoost engine (safe Windows tweaks)
  - Registry (conservative only)
  - Services & power plans
- 🧹 Disk & cache cleanup
  - Temp files, browser cache, crash dumps
- 🌐 Network tweaks
  - DNS flush
  - TCP stack tuning (safe hints only)
- 🎮 Game presets
  - Lite / Best Performance / Competitive
- 📊 History & logs
  - Files cleaned, bytes freed, warnings
- 🖥️ In-game HUD overlay (CPU / RAM / Ping)
- 🔒 Almost everything is reversible by design

## What I’m Experimenting With (R&D)

These are **experiments**, not shipped features.

- 🧪 SmartBoost Intelligence
  - Collecting run metrics (files cleaned, warnings, bytes freed)
  - Exploring ML.NET + heuristics for “risk vs gain” scoring

- 🌡️ Safe Thermal Gain Mode
  - Reading CPU / RAM usage via Windows APIs
  - Designing UI + logic for safe power / cooling profiles  
  - No undervolting, no sketchy tricks

- 📈 PulseScore™ Concept
  - Simple Windows-level performance score
  - Based on cleanup results & system state
  - Later: integrate frame-time metrics

> I don’t ship anything unsafe to users. Experiments stay in R&D.

## Engineering Philosophy

- No fake optimizations  
- No irreversible system changes  
- No “one-click magic” claims  

If a feature can’t be explained, measured, or undone — it doesn’t belong.
